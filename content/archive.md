## Water Quality Assessment (May 2011)

The drinking water quality proved to be satisfactory on both chemical and biological parameters measured during the month (May 2011). The turbidity continues to be a bit of a challenge as it is always close to 1.0 NTU. We need this value to be less than 0.5 NTU consistently, but the plant as at present configured is not capable of achieving this. Capital funding will be required in order to upgrade the plant to the required standard.
