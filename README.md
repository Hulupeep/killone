The website is designed to be very simple to update. You don't need to be a computer expert! Here's how:

1.  **Request Access:**
    * To edit the website, you'll need access to this repository.
    * Please send an email to hollywoodsign AT gmail DOT com requesting access.
    * Once you've been granted access, you'll receive a notification from GitHub.
2.  **Log in to GitHub:**

    * Go to [https://github.com/hulupeep/killone](https://github.com/hulupeep/killone).
4.  **Find the Content:**
    * Click on the `content` folder. This is where all the website's text is stored.

7.  **Automatic Updates:**

**Technical Details (For Developers):**

This website is built using a static site generator called Eleventy (11ty).

* **Eleventy:**
    * Eleventy takes Markdown files in the `content` folder and HTML templates in the root directory and generates a static website.
    * This static website is then hosted on Vercel.
* **Vercel Deployment:**
    * This repository is connected to Vercel, a platform for deploying websites.
    * Whenever changes are committed to the `main` branch of this repository, Vercel automatically rebuilds and deploys the website.
    * This automation means that content editors do not need to worry about the technical details of website deployment.
* **Markdown:**
    * The website content is written in Markdown, a simple markup language that is easy to learn and use.
* **Future Updates:**
    * We plan to integrate Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) to provide a more user-friendly visual editor for content updates.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Content Creation/Editing:**
    * Content editors edit Markdown files directly in the GitHub web interface.
2.  **Version Control:**
    * Git tracks all changes made to the website content.
3.  **Automatic Deployment:**
    * Vercel automatically deploys the website whenever changes are committed to the `main` branch.
4.  **Website Hosting:**
    * Vercel hosts the final website.
