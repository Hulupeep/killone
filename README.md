## üìö Quick Markdown Guide

Markdown is easy to use for formatting:

- **Headings**: Add `#` before your heading:
  ```markdown
  # Big Heading
  ## Subheading
  ### Smaller Heading
  ```

- **Paragraphs**: Just type your text. Leave a blank line between paragraphs.

- **Bold**: Put two asterisks before and after:  
  `**bold text**`

- **Italics**: Put one asterisk before and after:  
  `*italic text*`

- **Links**:
  `[Link Text](https://example.com)`

- **Images**:
  Upload the image into the `content` folder and include it like this:  
  `![Image description](/image.png)`  
  Replace `image.png` with your image filename.

- **Lists**: Use dashes for bullet points:
  ```markdown
  - Item one
  - Item two
  ```
